		"Gut health isn't just about digestion—it's the foundation of energy, focus, and how we feel all day. But for many of us, busy schedules and inconsistent habits lead to bloating, irregular digestion, and daily discomfort. We wanted better for ourselves and for everyone juggling wellness with real life.",
		"So we teamed up with gut health researchers to create a solution that actually works. Our formula is built around three targeted types of fiber—soluble, insoluble, and prebiotic—that work together to feed beneficial bacteria and regulate digestive function. Unlike outdated single-fiber options, it's a complete system rooted in the best of clinical science and made simple for everyday use.",
		"Our mission is to help you feel your best without overhauling your routine. Customers tell us they feel more energized, less weighed down, and more in control—from better digestion to more balanced days overall. Because when your gut works, everything else does too. We're here to make that your new normal."
